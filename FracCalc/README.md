# FracCalc

[Nashorn.java](Nashorn.java) is a really cheeky implementation of a "Fractional Calculator"
that uses JavaScript's `eval` and the Nashorn script engine to parse and return values.
Needless to say, I wasn't allowed to submit this.

[FracCalc.java](FracCalc.java) is something that I made in about half an hour to satisfy
Gradescope and [the project requirements](instructions.pdf).

There's more where this came from in
[my Fractional Calculators repository](https://github.com/Coalpha/fractional-calculators)
