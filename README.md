# Computer Science Java (cs-java)

This repository is full of stuff that's for my computer science class.
It's taught in Java since that's what the AP-CS standards require.
Inside this repository is disorganized and messy code that's too small or too bad to deserve it's own repository.

### Style

Project directories should be in `PascalCase`.
Other directories for miscellaneous code should be in `kebab-case`

- [Fractional Calculator](FracCalc)
- [In-Class work](in-class)
- [Practice-It](practice-it)
- [Snake Game](SnakeGame)
